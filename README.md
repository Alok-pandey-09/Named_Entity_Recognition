# Named_Entity_Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing. Initially, we will focus on creating a NER model that identifies key tokens and classifies them into set of predefined entities. The number of scientific papers published per year has exploded in recent years, strengthening its value as one of the main drivers for scientific progress. In astronomy alone, more than 41,000 new articles are published every year and the vast majority are available either via an open-access model or via pre-print services. Indexing the articleâ€™s full-text in search engines helps discover and retrieve vital scientific information to continue building on the shoulders of giants, informing policy, and making evidence-based decisions. Nevertheless, it is difficult to navigate in this ocean of data; finding articles rely heavily on string matching searches and following citations/references. NER helps us extract key information from scientific papers which can help search engines to better select and filter articles. For this, we will first train a language model on WIESP dataset. We will define and train a simple RNN network with 2 RNN layers as our baseline model. Then we will play around with BiLSTMs, Time Distributed Layers, BERT and much more.
